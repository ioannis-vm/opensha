This zip file contains fault model parent fault sections (prior to sub sectioning) and do not reflectcreep reductions.

This zip file contains deformation model minisection files as provided by the individual modelers. Slip rates are not yet reduced for creep.

Each CSV file contains the following columns: `<minisection>,<start lon>,<start lat>,<end lon>,<end lat>,<slip rate (mm/yr)>,<rake>`

Minisection refers to each span between points on the fault trace. A perfectly straight fault with only start and end points would only have a single minisection, while a fault with N kinks/bends will have N+1 minisections. Deformation modelers assign slip rates and rakes to each of these minisections, denoted by `<fault section ID>.<mini section index>`. For example, the first minisection on the Carrizo section of the San Andreas Fault (with ID 300), would be denoted as '300.01'. A list of fault section IDs and names for each fault model are also given in the files 'FM3_*_fault_names.txt'

This zip file contains deformation model sub section files generated by mapping the minisection data on to our sub sections. These files also reflect creep reductions in both the upper seismogenic depth and slip rate.
