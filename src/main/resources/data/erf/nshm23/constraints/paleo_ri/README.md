Updates from the original file:

* Changed location of Mystic Lake to 33.898097,-117.086080 after crossreferencing aerial imagry in Google Maps with figure 3 of Onderdonk et al (2013) (which is less obstructed than the version in their 2018 paper)

7/15/2022 Kevin Milner

* Increased precision of site locations for prior sites used in UCERF3 using UCERF3 data file (typically 2 decimal places to 4)
* Used exact location for 18th Ave SSAF site from Castillo et al., (2021, doi: 10.1130/GES02237.1). Note that rounding was slightly off in Devin's table for the longitude value (-116.538 was erroneously rounded to -116.59)
* Moved location of 1000 Palms site to location on Mill Creek, crossreferencing location mapped in Figure 2 of Fumal et al. (2002, doi: 10.1785/0120000609) with Google maps: 33.8376,-116.3094


## Wasatch Paleo Data

File name: wasatch_paleo_data_2022_11_10.csv

Data file provided by Chris Duross on 11/10/2022 (by e-mail, subject "Wasatch paleosites"). Here are his notes:

"See the attached spreadsheet, which has all the sites (including Bowden Canyon), with more accurate Lat/Longs provided. Note that I double checked the rates in this table, and they match those in Valentini et al. (2019) table 2. I added the parent sections to the table, but wasn't sure where to find the subsection indices (am happy to add those if needed)."
