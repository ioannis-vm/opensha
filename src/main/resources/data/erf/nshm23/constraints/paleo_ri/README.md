## CA Paleo Data

File name: McPhillips_California_RIs_2022_07_13.csv

Data from Devin McPhillips via e-mail on 7/13/2022, subject "RI table". According to Devin, "This has been bureau approved and accepted pending minor revision at SRL, which were submitted yesterday."

Updated on 7/15/2022 by Kevin Milner with the following modifications:

* Increased precision of site locations for prior sites used in UCERF3 using UCERF3 data file (typically 2 decimal places to 4)
* Used exact location for 18th Ave SSAF site from Castillo et al., (2021, doi: 10.1130/GES02237.1). Note that rounding was slightly off in Devin's table for the longitude value (-116.538 was erroneously rounded to -116.59)
* Moved location of 1000 Palms site to location on Mill Creek, crossreferencing location mapped in Figure 2 of Fumal et al. (2002, doi: 10.1785/0120000609) with Google maps: 33.8376,-116.3094


## Wasatch Paleo Data

File name: wasatch_paleo_data_2022_08_04.csv

Wasatch paleo RI data, taken from the code used for Valentini et al. (2020). Site locations were digitized from relevant paper figures by Alex Hatem on 8/4/2022, delivered via e-mail (subject line "Wasatch Paleo Data"). Alex's notes:

"I used Figure 1 from Valentini et al as a guide, and matched numbered sites in that figure to the site index from Table 2. I digitized the figure axes and the site locations ('digitize2.m), and then snapped those lat, lons to the fault sections geometries (QGIS). The locations may be not precisely where the trench was excavated, but is in a more meaningful location than the mid point of each section (sorry for the detail - these notes are mostly to jog my own mind if and when the time comes!)"
