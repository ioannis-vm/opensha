# Regional Polygons

These geojsons define areas over which comparative rate analyses between models and modeling approaches can be performed for NSHM updates. Hawaii and Alaska are the regions used for hazard map calculations. The Conterminous U.S. (CONUS) polygons preserve the RELM testing region for comparison with UCERF3 and then define Pacific Northwest, Intermountain West, and Central and Eastern U.S. regions. There are also local regions for use in high risk/exposure areas.

## Revisions

- Version 1 for the conterminous U.S consisted of 3 polygons, east to west.
- Version 2 for the conterminous U.S. preserves the RELM testing region and adds a Pacific Northwest region
- Version 2 updates the polygon for Alaska
- Version 3 updates the intermountain-west CEUS boundary to be the updated 'attenuation boundary' for the 2023 update. This boundary is used to separate catalogs and for GMM-source pairings.
 - Intermediate: Kevin Milner stitched together the conus regions to create one single region, and then also chopped it off at -100 degrees for a WUS model
