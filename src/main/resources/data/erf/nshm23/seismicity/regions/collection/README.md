# Collection Regions

Polygons that define the extent of the catalog considered in Conterminous U.S. gridded seismicity
sources. These are also used as the bounds for spatial PDFs (or rate grids) when smoothing
declustered catalogs. In order to inlude all points and not duplicate any points on the
principal lines of latitude (24° and 50°) and longitude (-126°, -104°, and -66°) defining the
WUS and CEUS regions, each outer boundary is offset by 0.05°, and the dividing line betwen WUS
and CEUS is set at -103.95°.
